# RolyDex

## Project status

RolyDex is a contacts management application. Current version supports basic contact information; future versions will also include a notes management system.


## Description

RolyDex's mission is to help its users connect with those they care about more frequently, and with with _intent_. RolyDex encourages users to check in with one person daily- for as short or long a time as the user would like. Notes will help users jot notes for each phone call, so that they never have to say "oh, I don't remember you telling me that" ever again. RolyDex will also gently remind users when a birthday is approaching, so that belated birthday cards are a thing of the past, once and for all.


## Installation

Fork and clone the repository to your local environment. To install all necessary gems, simple execute the `bundle install` command.

Then, still from your terminal, execute the `shotgun` command and open your browser. Your server will be found at `localhost:9393`.
